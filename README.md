## Usage

This site shows interactions with bootstrap and moments to create a daily planner of sorts. Users can add text to the 
boxes in the middle of the "calender", save this data, and it will come up on page reload. The sections also change color
based on the time pulled from the device.

## Credits
Portions of this code pull heavily from the example giving in the GitHub for the class, examples provided from websites such as Stack OverFlow and GitHub, and interactions with other web developers' input.
